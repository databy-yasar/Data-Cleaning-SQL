# Data-Cleaning-SQL
Data Cleaning in SQL – A personal project demonstrating how to clean and prepare raw data using SQL queries.


This project showcases how I cleaned and prepared raw data using SQL.

## Project Overview
The original Excel file contained common real-world issues such as duplicate rows, incorrect data types, and missing values.  
Using a series of SQL queries, I:

- Removed duplicate records to ensure data accuracy  
- Converted dates and numeric columns to the correct data types  
- Handled null or missing values to make the dataset ready for analysis  

The final cleaned table is structured and reliable, making it suitable for reporting or further analytics.
